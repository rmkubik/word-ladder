# Portland Word Ladder

This repository was created for fun after I played a word ladder someone else made. I authored it on paper as a way to get away from screens while making games. I couldn't help myself though, so now it's a web app!

## Build your own

If you clone this repository, it should be relatively straightforward to make your own word ladder. There are two main data files that feed into the puzzle.

The first is a [settings.yaml](data/settings.yaml) file that contains things like the game's title, rules, and example.

The main file is [ladder.txt](data/ladder.txt). It contains an answer word of any length and then a clue separated by a space. The first block of characters will be treated as the answer, the rest of the line after the first space character will be treated as the clue.

**For example:**

```
CARD It comes in a deck
```

`CARD` would be the answer and the clue would be `It comes in a deck`.
